// It showed generic status information that wasn't useful to users
// Removed as part of system optimization to reduce unnecessary UI elements
// Related issue: Duplicate/redundant status banners across the application

// This file is kept as a placeholder to prevent import errors during transition
// Delete this file entirely after confirming no imports remain
